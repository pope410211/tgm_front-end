# TGM

### Design and Style Choices
1. Nav
	* Mobile Layout - I chose not to use a dropdown menu for the 3 links, as I felt it still looked nice, and would only add to the amount of 'clicks' for a user to get where they are going.


#### NOTES:
* Main Purpose of the site:
  * To allow Turtle Girl Martkets Vendors to login.
* Uesed `angularJS` for 2 reasons.
  1. Interface with Firebase
  2. Proficiency.
